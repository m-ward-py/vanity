vanity py
I have just started my journey learning Python and after going through web tutorials and following along with different YouTube videos I wanted to create something, no matter how simple. I found myself sat on Instagram liking different pieces of artwork until I thought "what if I can write a script to do that for me" so that is what I have set out to do.

I am very new to Github (and Python) so any advice or bits of knowledge would be much appreciated from anyone that has taken the time to read this! (even how to write a good readme file would be a great start!)

The script itself isn't complicated with a couple of fuctions to input and then interacts with Instagram to farm likes, which I wouldn't recommend doing too much of as I doubt Instagram will like that. It was purely for experience writing a script and to have something to show for my first commit.

For the script you need to have ChromeDriver installed and it only works in Chrome.

Thanks again for checking this out.
